# Z-Voting
A completely anonymous and private Voting framework based on zero-knowledge proof.

# How it works
Everyone who wants to Participate in a Voting must have a VotingID, which you can build using GENERATE VOTINGID button, [Here is the helper video](https://github.com/AMIRKHANEF/ZK-Gasless-Voting/blob/main/README.md#how-to-use)

For initiating a voting first you should insert the voting title, then you need to have the voters VotingID and add them in the to Voting, after that you sign the transaction and a voting smart contract will deploy on your selected blockchain, finally when everything goes well, you should share the deployed voting smart contract address with the voters. [Here is the helper video]().
